  <h4>Let's begin our learning journey!</h4>
  <p>In this journey I've a very old friend (not old age) who is just behind me watching and giving me the helping hand wherever neccesaary.
  His name is <strong>Ranaji</strong>. He is a aspiring full stack web developer and has been in this field for more than 2 years. He has worked on various projects and has a lot of experience in the industry.</p>
  <p>Ranaji is always there to help me out with any doubts or queries I have. He is a great mentor and a good friend. I am grateful to have him by my side in this journey.</p>
  <p>Let's make the most of this opportunity and learn as much as we can. Happy coding!
  Then I've a mentor Shradha ji, who is teaching me the basics of web development. She is very patient and explains everything in detail. I am learning a lot from her and I hope to become a good developer one day.</p>
